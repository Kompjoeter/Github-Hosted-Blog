To use this project to make a blog of your own you'll need the following:

<ul>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>main.css*</li>
<li>blog-control.js</li>
<li>posts.json</li>
<li>a folder with blogposts in .txt</li>
</ul>

Of course you are free to edit the main.css to your liking.

<b>Then what?</b>

Type some blogposts and save them as a .txt. The filename can be anything but it helps if it's immediately recognizable as a specific blogpost (Also, each blogpost .txt should have a unique name).

Now make sure your posts.json's formatting looks like this (New blogposts are added at the bottom of the array):
<br><br>
<pre>
[
	{
		"title": "Description",
		"date":"2020/08/18",
		"file": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RanDByyp/Github-Stored-Blog/master/blogposts/2020-08-18-description.txt"
	},
	
	{
		"title": "Usage",
		"date":"2020/08/18",
		"file": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RanDByyp/Github-Stored-Blog/master/blogposts/2020-08-18-usage.txt"
	}
]
</pre>

As I stated before, every object in the array represents a blogpost. It has a 'title' (string), a 'date' (string) and 'file' (string).
Edit the title and date to your liking, but make sure the 'file' links to the correct url holding the .txt that contains the correct content for your blogpost.
<br><br>
Considering you'll store your blogposts in your github repo, make sure the url in 'file' is a 'raw' url.
