To use this project to make a blog of your own you'll need the following files from <a href="https://github.com/RanDByyp/Github-Stored-Blog">this</a> repository:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>main.css*</li>
<li>blog-control.js</li>
<li>posts.json</li>
<li>a folder with blogposts in .txt</li>
</ul>
<br>
<i>*Of course you are free to edit the main.css to fit your own preferences.</i>
<br><br>
<h2>Creating the blogposts</h2>
<br>
Write some blogposts and save them as a .txt. The filename can be anything but to keep things organized it helps if it's immediately recognizable as a specific blogpost. Each blogpost .txt should have a unique name. 
<br><br>
You can use HTML tags inside your blogposts .txt and they will be applied as such. You <b>don't</b> have to add a title or date at the top of your blogpost. This will be done automatically, as they are read from your posts.json file.
<br><br>
Upload the .txt files to your github repository, preferably in a folder named 'blogposts'.
<br><br>
<b>!- Even if you deploy your blog from gh-pages, you only need to upload your blogposts .txt's to your master branch. You can simply link to them with an url as I will explain below.</b>
<br><br>
<h2>Setting up the .json file</h2>
<br>
As I've stated before, every object in the array represents a blogpost. It has a <b>'title'</b> (string), a <b>'date'</b> (string) and <b>'file'</b>(string). New blogposts are added at the bottom of the array.
<br><br>
Edit the title and date to your liking, but make sure the 'file' links to the correct url holding the .txt that contains the correct content for your blogpost.
<br><br>
Make sure the url in 'file' is a 'raw' url, otherwise the 'fetch' operation to grab the blogpost .txt will fail. 
<br><br>
When you navigate to the .txt file in your repository, there should be a button titled 'raw' somewhere on the screen, click it and copy the url in your adress-bar. Post the copied link behind "file":, in your .json file. Make sure the url is inbetween "".
<br><br>
Make sure your posts.json's formatting looks something like this:
<br><br>
<div style="border:#484848 solid 1px"> 
<pre>
[
	{
		"title": "Description",
		"date":"2020/08/18",
		"file": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RanDByyp/Github-Stored-Blog/master/blogposts/2020-08-18-description.txt"
	},
	
	{
		"title": "Usage",
		"date":"2020/08/18",
		"file": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RanDByyp/Github-Stored-Blog/master/blogposts/2020-08-18-usage.txt"
	}
]
</pre>
</div>
<br>
After you have edited the post.json to contain all your blogpost-data, upload it to your repository.
<br><br>
Now go into the blog-control.js file, and at the top of the file change the 'postsSource' variable so that it holds a string of the raw-url that links to your posts.json file in your repository.
<br><br>
<b>!- Even if you deploy your blog from gh-pages, you only need to upload your posts.json to your master branch. You can simply link to it with the raw-url, as just explained.</b>
<br><br>
<h2>Finishing up</h2>
<br>
Finally upload the index.html, main.css and blog-control.js to your repository and deploy the page to see if things are working correctly.
<br><br>
If you want add more blogposts in the future, you simply have to write content for it in a .txt. Upload the .txt to your 'blogposts' folder in your repository and add a new object to the array in your posts.json which will hold the title, date and raw-url of your new blogpost.
<br>
Good luck!
