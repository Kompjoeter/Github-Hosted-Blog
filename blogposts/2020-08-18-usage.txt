To use this project to make a blog of your own you'll need the following:

<ul>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>main.css*</li>
<li>blog-control.js</li>
<li>posts.json</li>
<li>a folder of blogposts in .txt</li>
</ul>

Of course you are free to edit the main.css to your liking.

<b>Then what?</b?>

Type some blogposts and save them as a .txt. The filename can be anything but it helps if it's immediately recognizable as a specific blogpost (Also, each blogpost .txt should have a unique name).

Now make sure your posts.json file links to your blogposts in the correct manner:
