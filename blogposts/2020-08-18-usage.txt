To use this project to make a blog of your own you'll need the following from this <a href="https://github.com/RanDByyp/Github-Stored-Blog">repo</a>:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>main.css*</li>
<li>blog-control.js</li>
<li>posts.json</li>
<li>a folder with blogposts in .txt</li>
</ul>
<br>
<i>Of course you are free to edit the main.css to your liking.</i>
<br><br>
<h2>Creating the blogposts</h2>
<br>
Write some blogposts and save them as a .txt. The filename can be anything but to keep things organized it helps if it's immediately recognizable as a specific blogpost. Each blogpost .txt should have a unique name. 
<br><br>
Upload the .txt files to your github repo, preferably in a folder named 'blogposts'.
<br><br>
<b>!- Even if you deploy your blog from gh-pages, you only need to upload your blogposts .txt's to your master branch. You can simply link to them with an url as I will explain below.</b>
<br><br>
<h2>Setting up the .json file</h2>
<br>
Now make sure your posts.json's formatting looks like this (New blogposts are added at the bottom of the array):
<br><br>
<pre>
[
	{
		"title": "Description",
		"date":"2020/08/18",
		"file": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RanDByyp/Github-Stored-Blog/master/blogposts/2020-08-18-description.txt"
	},
	
	{
		"title": "Usage",
		"date":"2020/08/18",
		"file": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RanDByyp/Github-Stored-Blog/master/blogposts/2020-08-18-usage.txt"
	}
]
</pre>
<br><br>
As I stated before, every object in the array represents a blogpost. It has a <b>'title'</b> (string), a <b>'date'</b> (string) and <b>'file'</b>(string).
Edit the title and date to your liking, but make sure the 'file' links to the correct url holding the .txt that contains the correct content for your blogpost.
<br><br>
Considering you'll store your blogposts in your github repo, make sure the url in 'file' is a 'raw' url.
